# Stay Curious
Curiosity has always been at the heart of everything I do. Growing up, I was endlessly fascinated by the world and how things work. Instead of rushing to define my career path, I let myself explore—a journey that took me from the rigorous "classes prépa" in France, through engineering school, and finally to earning a PhD. This approach allowed me to dive into what interests me most without confining myself to a traditional job title. I used to think I needed a fixed career label, but I’ve come to realize I’m happier without one. My goal is to find inspiring spaces where I can keep learning and where human values take precedence over profit.

# Interests
My PhD project was a transdisciplinary journey that sparked my curiosity across several fields. With the inspiring Flowers team, I explored how agents—primarily humans—autonomously explore their environments to develop new skills. My focus was on educational technologies, specifically on how theories from developmental psychology could help shape and personalize learning experiences. I dived into how cognitive training interventions, in particular, might be tailored to individuals using these insights. Through this work, I studied various cognitive mechanisms, like visual attention, intrinsic motivation, self-regulated learning, and metacognition. I also spent time exploring data visualization projects and experimenting with innovative methods for data analysis (#BayesianTeam).
